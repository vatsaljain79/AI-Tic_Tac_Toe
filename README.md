# Tic Tac Toe Game

A fun and interactive **Tic Tac Toe** game made with Python and Pygame. Play against the computer at varying difficulty levels, listen to soothing background music, and enjoy sound effects for clicks and wins.

## Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard, using the Minimax algorithm.
- **Sound Effects**: Background music, click sounds, and win sounds enhance the gameplay.
- **Dynamic UI**: Restart options and win/draw counters.
- **CSV Integration**: The game learns from previous games and can make smarter decisions over time by storing board states and best moves in a CSV file.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**:
    - Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
    - Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` script.

2. **Select Difficulty**:
    - You will be prompted to select the difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard.

3. **Gameplay**:
    - Player 'X' goes first.
    - Click on an empty cell to place your 'X' and compete against the computer's 'O'.
    - The game ends when either player wins or the board is full (draw).

4. **Restart**:
    - After a game ends, the restart screen will appear, showing the number of wins for both the player and the computer, as well as the number of draws. 
    - You can restart or change the difficulty at any time.
  
## Why Store States in CSV?
We use a CSV file to store game states (board configurations and the AIâ€™s corresponding moves) to:
- **Optimize Future Gameplay**: If the AI encounters a previously seen board state, it retrieves the best move from the CSV, speeding up decision-making.
- **Track Board States**: By recording game states, we can analyze past games for patterns or insights into how the AI has performed in various scenarios. This allows you to see which moves have been made in similar positions, though the AI does not learn from these records.

**Achievement**: You **cannot defeat the AI** at the Hard level, no matter how well you play. The Minimax algorithm ensures that the AI will either win or draw every game.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 'X' and Computer 'O' take turns marking their cells.
- The goal is to be the first to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

## Files

- `calm_music.mp3`: Background music played during the game.
- `tch.wav`: Click sound for selecting a cell.
- `win.wav`: Sound played when a player wins.
- `state.csv`: Stores board states and optimal moves for learning and future reference.

## Installation

1. **Install Pygame**:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
2. **Run the Game**:
    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional themes for different visual experiences.
- Add multiplayer functionality to compete against a friend.
